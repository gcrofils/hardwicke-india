    teaser: "<p>The Wolong Nature Reserve in Sichuan Province is the largest giant panda habitat in China. The endangered animal can be also found in some primitive forests in Shaanxi and Gansu provinces. About 400,000-500,000 years ago, “territory” of the giant panda included areas along the Yellow, Yangtze and Pearl rivers, as well as today’s Vietnam, Thailand, and northern Myanmar. In the lower Paleolithic epoch, giant pandas, saber-toothed tigers, and mammoths comprised Ailuropoda-Stegodon fauna that fed on bamboo.</p>"
    body: "<p>The giant panda’s diet is herbivorous, consisting almost exclusively of bamboo. As early as 1,700 years ago, Chinese people considered the giant panda a symbol of peace and called it “Zouyu” (a legendary animal representing righteousness and benevolence). If an army raised flags featuring the giant panda, the enemy would stop attacking. In 658, Empress Wu Zetian of the Tang Dynasty (618-907) presented two pandas as state gifts to the emperor of Japan.</p><p>French missionary, botanist and zoologist Armand David introduced the giant panda to the West. In 1869, when he first encountered the animal in Sichuan Province, David declared that it might be an “interesting, new species.” He sent a panda to Henri Milne Edwards, a zoologist in Musee d’Histoire Naturelle in Paris, who later published a paper asserting that the animal was a close relative of the red panda discovered earlier in Tibet. The animal was thus named the giant panda. In honor of its Western discoverer, the binomial of the giant panda is Ailuropoda melanoleuca David.</p><p>The giant panda prefers to inhabit areas near water sources and featuring gentle slopes and sparse bamboo forests. A panda can eat 5-10 kilograms of bamboo per day, but only 17 percent can be absorbed due to its poor digestive efficiency. For this reason, the giant panda must eat a massive volume to get enough nutrients. Despite its big head, an adult’s brain averages a volume of 310-320 milliliters, 60 milliliters less than the Asian black bear whose head is smaller. The giant panda has bad eyesight, but an acute sense of smell. It marks its territory with smell. Pandas also communicate with scent during mating season and determine whether food is edible at night completely based on smell. Its short and stubby tail seems practically useless, but it actually spreads a scent emitted from a gland beneath it. The giant panda’s enemies include leopards, jackals, and Asian golden cats. These predators cannot subdue a fully-grown adult panda, but they often attack those that are old, weak, or sick.</p><p>Pandas generally live solitarily as adults, with males and females congregating only during mating season. Pandas find shelter in hollow trees, rock crevices or bushes, but do not establish permanent dens. They spend most of the day eating and sleeping. They are most often seen feeding at dawn or dusk. Pandas move slowly unless they are disturbed. They can run fast when being chased. Along with the ability to swim, pandas excel at climbing trees, which is how they most often evade predators.</p><p>Pandas usually sleep in trees to keep safe from predators. It takes two or three minutes for a panda to climb a dozen meters up a tree. Before resting, a panda sways its branches to test their strength. Pandas don’t hibernate in winter, and their fat reserves make the hot summertime particularly unpleasant.</p><p>The average life span of wild pandas is 26 years. Female pandas are able to breed from age four or five. For males, the breeding age is five to six. The mating season for pandas stretches from March to May. Females are picky in choosing mates. Males fight to win favor of females.</p><p>The reproductive rate of pandas is low. For genetic and modern environmental reasons, many females now suffer from reproductive development problems or endocrine disorders, leading to abnormal ovulation and even lifelong infertility. Typically, a female panda bears only five or six litters in her lifetime. The gestation period ranges from four to five months, and a female delivers one or two cubs each time. When a cub is first born, it is pink and weighs only 95 to 140 grams. The cub cannot crawl on its own until five or six months after birth. During that period, the mother rarely leaves her den to feed. Raising a cub is a difficult task, which can hurt her health. If twins are born, usually only one survives in the wild because it is so easy for an exhausted mother to accidentally trample the other. After the lactation period, the mother teaches her cub how to feed and survive in the wild. While child-rearing, the mother will not mate until her cub matures. </p>"

    body: "<p>Suzhou, located in the south-eastern province of Jiangsu, is a city famed most of all for its canals and picturesque gardens. Spend more time there and you will actually find several other gems scattered across the city. The Suzhou museum for instance, worth a visit for the architecture in itself, has a great collection of artworks with at least 15,000 pieces that include ancient Chinese paintings, calligraphy, folk crafts, pottery and ceramics. The current building, inaugurated eight years ago, was designed by Chinese-American architect I.M. Pei, now for his innovative aesthetics, as for his signature pyramid at the Louvre.</p><p>The construct of this museum in Suzhou corresponds with its surroundings, a modern aspect that is still attuned to the past ¨C wood seamlessly connected to glass materials, small arches, a replica of a Chinese-style park, rocks and water. If Chinese art and history spark your curiosity, then do not hesitate to spend an afternoon there. I personally loved the exhibits on calligraphy and paintings, with masterpieces from the Song dynasty in the 12th century up to the Qing era (1644-1911).</p><p>The museum appealed to me in the way the site is seamlessly woven with the urban ‘fabric’ of Suzhou as a whole. There is indeed a sense of continuity between the rooftops, tones and hues one notices across town, and those used for the museum as well.</p><p>In the old area on Pingjiang road, you may also experience a slice of ‘old China’ through the shops of antiques and silk ware that line the river. In fact, the bridges and surrounding gardens were chosen as UNESCO World Heritage sites, and thus they have been well preserved and kept for you to enjoy. I particularly strolled around the Youyicun garden, with its ‘bucolic’ like entrance and age-old charm. The place I stayed at was near the Beisi pagoda, which I would walk past occasionally. The sight of it was especially impressive at night, when the whole structure lit up against the pitch-black sky.</p><p>Of course, no description of Suzhou would be complete without defining its core feature: silk production. I highly recommend the Suzhou Silk Museum that offers an extensive overview on this exquisite craft that has been around for millennia! The intricacy of fabrics, types of silk and resulting garments are magical to look at. The museum’s informative displays give you a glimpse at silk-production both as a complex art form and a cultural ‘jewel’ of China. Definitely a highlight of my sightseeing there!</p><p>Now Suzhou has over two million inhabitants, and this ‘Venice of the East’ certainly has a long-lasting effect on newcomers. My first time there was on a trip from nearby Shanghai (a quick zip on the train). I hope to re-discover Suzhou again in the near future. I find Suzhou’s atmosphere fascinating: the cobbled streets, colours and shapes, ornaments and the trees’ shadows, all imbued with a distinctive light that makes it an artful place to wander. No wonder Suzhou has been a fixture on artists' minds and eyes for a while now¡­</p><p>According to an ancient Chinese poem:<br/>上有天堂，下有苏杭<br/>'In Heaven there is Paradise, on Earth there are Suzhou and Hangzhou'"

    body: "<p><b>Genesis</b></p><p>The history of “panda diplomacy” can be traced back more than 1,000 years in China. According to historical records of Japan, Wu Zetian, the only female monarch in Chinese history, presented two giant pandas and 70 pelts of panda fur as state gifts to the emperor of Japan.<p></p>In 1869, French missionary Armand David transported a panda specimen to Musee d’Histoire Naturelle in Paris. Ever since, the animal has been known to the Western world. Obsessed with the fantastic creature, many European explorers began to swarm China in search of giant pandas. In December 1935, American fashion designer Ruth Harkness brought a three-month-old panda cub, which was later named Su Lin, back to the United States. Sadly, the panda died of pneumonia on April 1, 1938, and was stuffed and displayed in the Field Museum in Chicago.<p></p>In 1941, on behalf of the government of the Republic of China (1912-1949), Soong May-ling (Madame Chiang Kai-shek) presented a pair of giant pandas as gifts to a U.S. non-governmental organization in appreciation of its help to Chinese refugees during World War II.</p><p><b>“Communist” Pandas</b></p><p>Not until 1957 did the government of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) use pandas as diplomatic gifts. That year, a panda named Ping Ping was given as a state gift to the Soviet Union, the first country in the world to establish diplomatic relations with the PRC. Two years later, another panda, An An, was transported to the Soviet Union to mate with Ping Ping. Between 1965 and 1980, China gave five giant pandas as gifts to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.<p></p>In the early years of the PRC, the country suffered a diplomatic blockade from Western countries, so for a long time after 1949, the giant panda was only gifted to China’s socialist allies. For this reason, the animal even absorbed a “communist” aura. Although China didn’t deliberately block giant pandas from traveling to Western countries, ideological differences and political disagreements hindered the spread of the rare and adorable animal to zoos around the world.<p></p>From 1956 to 1957, the Miami Rare Bird Farm and the Chicago Zoo twice wrote to the Beijing Zoo, offering “money or other animals” in exchange for giant pandas.<p></p>According to a 1956 record from the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Landscape and Forestry, Beijing Zoo had three pandas at the time, two of which were earmarked to be given to the Soviet Union. In hopes of melting the icy relations between China and the United States, the Chinese Foreign Ministry replied that China accepted the deal in principle, but asked that both sides send delegations to visit each other and complete the deal face-to-face, instead of through a third party.<p></p>Despite the Miami Rare Bird Farm and the Chicago Zoo’s enthusiasm about acquiring giant pandas, the deal was vetoed by the U.S. Department of State. During the same period, other Western countries including Britain and the Netherlands also requested giant panda trades with China, but were refused with the excuse that “the animal was an endangered species and hard to capture.”</p><p><b>Journey to the West</b></p><p>On February 21, 1972, U.S. President Richard Nixon visited China upon an invitation from Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai. Two pandas, Ling Ling and Hsing Hsing, were presented as gifts to the United States. Upon the pandas’ arrival at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., 8,000 visitors were waiting in rain to greet them. More than 1 million people went to see the pandas within a month.<p></p>After that, pandas began being dispatched as gifts to countries around the world, marking a height of China’s “panda diplomacy.” In 1973, nine years after it established diplomatic relations with China, France received a pair of pandas, Yan Yan and Li Li. In 1974, China gave two pandas, Tian Tian and Bao Bao, to Germany. Britain eventually welcomed Jia Jia and Jing Jing. From 1957 to 1982, China gave 23 pandas to nine different countries as diplomatic gifts. “In the 1970s, China navigated sharp twists and turns when establishing diplomatic relations with Western countries,” remarks Ye Linhai, an expert in international affairs at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. “The giant panda made a considerable impact on the process.”</p><p><b>Research Cooperation</b></p><p>The population of giant pandas has dropped sharply due to environmental deterioration of their habitats. In 1982, China stopped giving the animal away as gifts to foreign nations, but they were still offered by China’s mainland to Hong Kong and Taiwan.<p></p>In 1984, China launched a program to loan pandas to other nations. Because such commercial activity could negatively impact the animal’s breeding, the program was halted in the mid-1990s. Now, the only way for a foreign zoo to acquire the animal from China is through research cooperation according to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, passed in 1975.<p></p>With a research cooperation agreement, a foreign zoo can keep a panda on a 10-year lease. The standard loan terms include rental of US$ 500,000 per year and a provision that any cubs born during the loan remain the property of China. In addition, the zoo is obligated to support wild panda conservation efforts.<p></p>In 1994, Japan’s Shirahama Animal Park acquired two pandas from Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding after they reached a research cooperation deal. On February 23, 2014, two pandas, Xing Hui and Hao Hao, from Dujiangyan Giant Panda Protection and Research Center, were delivered to Belgium, where they will stay for 15 years. To date, more than 30 pandas have been transported to foreign zoos in the name of research cooperation.<p></p>Like their ancestors who were presented as state gifts to foreign countries, such pandas remain goodwill ambassadors of China. “Yes, pandas make the perfect diplomats,” commented The New Zealand Herald. </p>"

In 1982, China stopped giving the animal away as gifts to foreign nations, but they were still offered by China’s mainland to Hong Kong and Taiwan.<p></p>In 1984, China launched a program to loan pandas to other nations. Because such commercial activity could negatively impact the animal’s breeding, the program was halted in the mid-1990s. Now, the only way for a foreign zoo to acquire the animal from China is through research cooperation according to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, passed in 1975.<p></p>With a research cooperation agreement, a foreign zoo can keep a panda on a 10-year lease. The standard loan terms include rental of US$ 500,000 per year and a provision that any cubs born during the loan remain the property of China. In addition, the zoo is obligated to support wild panda conservation efforts.<p></p>In 1994, Japan’s Shirahama Animal Park acquired two pandas from Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding after they reached a research cooperation deal. On February 23, 2014, two pandas, Xing Hui and Hao Hao, from Dujiangyan Giant Panda Protection and Research Center, were delivered to Belgium, where they will stay for 15 years. To date, more than 30 pandas have been transported to foreign zoos in the name of research cooperation.<p></p>Like their ancestors who were presented as state gifts to foreign countries, such pandas remain goodwill ambassadors of China. “Yes, pandas make the perfect diplomats,” commented The New Zealand Herald. </p>"
